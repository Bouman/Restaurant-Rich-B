    <p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> is a new certificate authority. We created this page to show you our first certificate.</p>
    <div id="http">
      <h2 class="through-line">We're trusted</h2>
      <p>Let's Encrypt is now trusted by a majority of the web browsers, as planned in our <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/08/07/updated-lets-encrypt-launch-schedule.html">launch schedule</a>. Website users no longer need to add our <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/">ISRG root certificate</a> to utilize certificates issued by Let's Encrypt.</p>
      <p>Now that we're trusted, this page should have loaded without errors or warnings, and you should see a lock icon in the URL bar.  Click the lock!  In the security information, you should see something like "Verified by: Let's Encrypt".  You can use your browser's certificate viewer to see the details of the certificate.</p>
